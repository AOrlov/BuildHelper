# BuildHelper

Visual Studio 2013/2015 extension used to stop/start/restart services and processes before/after build. 

Constantly getting errors like the ones below? 
Error		Could not copy "obj\Release\Test.dll" to "..\bin\Release\Test.dll". Exceeded retry count of 10. Failed.		
Error		Unable to copy file "obj\Release\Test.dll" to "..\bin\Release\Test.dll". The process cannot access the file '..\bin\Release\Test.dll' because it is being used by another process

Having to worry if your services/processes using the dlls are stopped before building? Keep forgetting to restart them?

Then this extension is for you!
